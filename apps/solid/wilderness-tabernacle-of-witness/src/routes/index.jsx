            Who We Are
          </h4>
          <p>
            We are Phil and Dianne Nordan and we accepted the 
            Lord's plan of salvation in 1983. 
            Where we are today, we owe to the mercy and grace 
            of the Almighty and two individuals - Mr. Phill Simpson 
            (now with the Lord) and Mr. Ralph H. Mount (now with the Lord).
          </p>
          <p>
            I met Phill Simpson in 1985 and in the same year, 
            he introduced me to his mentor, Ralph Mount. 
            Both of these men were tremendous servants of the Lord 
            and very dear friends and supporters of Israel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ralph Mount taught me how to study the Bible. 
            On many occasions, I would call him with questions 
            and he would never answer them directly, 
            but told me where to find the answer -- in the word of the Lord. 
            You must remember, the only inspired word is the 
            Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the efforts of Al Greenway of Ocala, Florida, 
            I was able to acquire Ralph's model of the Wilderness Tabernacle 
            and his collection of books, totalling about 2,000. 
            Many of these books were written in the 1800's when books were 
            written for historical reasons instead of for profit. 
            All of these items are now available in our Museum in Monroe, 
            North Carolina.

            We love to talk about the Tabernacle and discuss scripture.

            The Wilderness Tabernacle
          </h4>
          <p>
            And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
            Speak unto the children of Israel, 
            that they bring me an offering: 
            of every man that giveth it willingly with 
            his heart ye shall take my offering. 
            And this is the offering which ye 
            shall take of them; gold, and silver, 
            and brass, and blue, and purple, 
            and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' 
            hair, and rams' skins dyed red, 
            and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 
            oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, 
            and for sweet incense, onyx stones, 
            and stones to be set in the ephod, 
            and in the breastplate. And let them make me a sanctuary; 
            that I may dwell among them. 
            According to all that I shew thee, 
            after the pattern of the tabernacle, 
            and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, 
            even so shall ye make it. Exodus 25: 1-9.

            Why study the Wilderness Tabernacle?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Revelations 13:6 – “and it-opened ( the beast) its mouth 
            with-reference-to blasphemies towards the God, to-blaspheme his name 
            and his tabernacle and the ones tabernacling in the heavens.

          <h4 class="text-2xl mb-2 mt-4 font-bold text-gray-600">
            If the Beast hates the Tabernacle it must be worth studying.

            Ralph H. Mount, Jr. has produced the most 
            comprehensive account of the Tabernacle 
            I have ever read. There are truths written 
            in his works that I have never seen in 
            any other work. Mr. Mount was born in 1911, 
            and he received his first model of the 
            Tabernacle when he was about 14 years old. 
            During the 1940’s he started the model you 
            see on this web site which is a 1 inch = 1 cubit 
            (18 inches) model of real gold, silver, brass, 
            shittim wood, etc. As he studied and learned he 
            made changes as his knowledge of the works of the 
            Lord progressed. His work is so important 
            we have copied his entire book on this web page 
            for your information and study.
