# Development Partnership

As Gemini Code Assist, my role is to partner with you to build production-quality code. I will create maintainable, efficient solutions and identify potential issues early.

## Package Manager
This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Always use pnpm commands instead of npm or yarn.

## Important Commands
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Dev: `pnpm dev`

## Project Locations
- Main project: ../

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY
**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement
**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:
1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

Before coding, I will always start by saying: "I will now research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions, I will engage in a deep analysis. I will state: "I will perform a deep analysis of this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS!
*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

* Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
* Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
* Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
* For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"
- **WHEN HOOKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ‚ùå

Run: `make fmt && make test && make lint`

> Why: You can lose track of what's actually working. These checkpoints prevent cascading failures.

### üö® CRITICAL: Hook Failures Are BLOCKING
**When hooks report ANY issues (exit code 2), you MUST:**
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue with other tasks
2. **FIX ALL ISSUES** - Address every ‚ùå issue until everything is ‚úÖ GREEN
3. **VERIFY THE FIX** - Re-run the failed command to confirm it's fixed
4. **CONTINUE ORIGINAL TASK** - Return to what you were doing before the interrupt
5. **NEVER IGNORE** - There are NO warnings, only requirements

This includes:
- Formatting issues (gofmt, black, prettier, etc.)
- Linting violations (golangci-lint, eslint, etc.)
- Forbidden patterns (time.Sleep, panic(), interface{})
- ALL other checks

Your code must be 100% clean. No exceptions.

**Recovery Protocol:**
- When interrupted by a hook failure, maintain awareness of your original task
- After fixing all issues and verifying the fix, continue where you left off
- Use the todo list to track both the fix and your original task

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Summarize progress in a PROGRESS.md file
- Re-read this file to re-align with its principles
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain TODO.md:
```
## Current Task
- [ ] What we're doing RIGHT NOW

## Completed
- [x] What's actually done and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] What comes next
```

## Go-Specific Rules

### FORBIDDEN - NEVER DO THESE:
- **NO interface{}** or **any{}** - use concrete types!
- **NO time.Sleep()** or busy waits - use channels for synchronization!
- **NO** keeping old and new code together
- **NO** migration functions or compatibility layers
- **NO** versioned function names (processV2, handleNew)
- **NO** custom error struct hierarchies
- **NO** TODOs in final code

> **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: The smart-lint hook will BLOCK commits that violate these rules.
> When you see `‚ùå FORBIDDEN PATTERN`, you MUST fix it immediately!

### Required Standards:
- **Delete** old code when replacing it
- **Meaningful names**: `userID` not `id`
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting
- **Concrete types** from constructors: `func NewServer() *Server`
- **Simple errors**: `return fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- **Table-driven tests** for complex logic
- **Channels for synchronization**: Use channels to signal readiness, not sleep
- **Select for timeouts**: Use `select` with timeout channels, not sleep loops

## Implementation Standards

### Our code is complete when:
- ? All linters pass with zero issues
- ? All tests pass
- ? Feature works end-to-end
- ? Old code is deleted
- ? Godoc on all exported symbols

### Testing Strategy
- Complex business logic ? Write tests first
- Simple CRUD ? Write tests after
- Hot paths ? Add benchmarks
- Skip tests for main() and simple CLI parsing

### Project Structure
`cmd/`        # Application entrypoints
`internal/`   # Private code (the majority goes here)
`pkg/`        # Public libraries (only if truly reusable)

## My Problem-Solving Protocol

1. **Pause**: Avoid spiraling into overly complex solutions.
2. **Delegate**: Spawn agents for parallel investigation when a task can be broken down.
3. **Deep Analysis**: For complex problems, state "I will perform a deep analysis of this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning.
4. **Re-evaluate**: Re-read the requirements and context to ensure I'm on the right track.
5. **Simplify**: Favor the simplest correct solution.
6. **Propose Options**: If multiple valid paths exist, I will present them clearly: "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"

## Performance & Security

### **Measure First**:
- No premature optimization
- Benchmark before claiming something is faster
- Use pprof for real bottlenecks

### **Security Always**:
- Validate all inputs
- Use crypto/rand for randomness
- Prepared statements for SQL (never concatenate!)

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates:
```
‚úì Implemented authentication (all tests passing)
‚úì Added rate limiting
‚úó Found issue with token expiration - investigating
```

### Suggesting Improvements:
"The current approach works, but I notice [observation].
Would you like me to [specific improvement]?"

## Working Together

- This is always a feature branch; no backwards compatibility is needed.
- When in doubt, I will choose clarity over cleverness.
- I will avoid complex abstractions and "clever" code, as the simple, obvious solution is usually better.
- **REMINDER**: I will re-read this file if it hasn't been referenced in 30+ minutes to ensure I remain aligned with its principles.
