This project is currently no longer in use. For the more up to date version, check out https://github.com/dev-daedalus/web-crawlers-PY/.
A place where I store any web crawlers I made in Python. Originally I was saving each crawler as its own repo, but eventually I got tired of creating new projects that were all essentially the same, so now they are all stored here.

Feel free to use it and change it how you like - This operates under MIT licence.
