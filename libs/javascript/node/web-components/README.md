This is just a place where I store anything cool that I made in JavaScript that arn't quite big enough or "stand alone" enough to be  their own repo. A "Minor Tinkerings" repo.

There are several different things in here classified by folder (other -> tinkerFunctions)

Feel free to use it and change it how you like - This operates under MIT licence.
